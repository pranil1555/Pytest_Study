This is a simple script using pytest that tests the addition function. It's good to show that you know how to set up basic test cases.


Key Concepts Covered:
Basic Assertions: Simple test cases with assert.
Fixtures: For setup and teardown logic (sample_data).
Parameterized Tests: Using @pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple input sets.
Parameterized Fixtures: Iterating through predefined fixture parameters.
Markers: Custom markers like @pytest.mark.slow and conditional skipping.
Expected Exceptions: Ensuring exceptions are raised as expected (pytest.raises).
Test Classes: Organizing related tests under a single class.
Dependency Injection: Sharing data between tests using fixtures.
Dynamic Test Cases: Generating test cases programmatically
